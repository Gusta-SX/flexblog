# FlexBlog

## About
This project was developed during the **CSS Flexbox** course of [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/). Using only the **properties of the **CSS3* flexbox**, a fully responsive design has been created for all screens. In addition, Iâ€™m looking to implement some modifications with **Javascript** for better project progress, such as a cleaner scroll for internal links and a *dark mode*, which changes the colors of the entire site to its darkest opposite.
